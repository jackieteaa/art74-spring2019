I wanted to do this project to teach NASA to try to send a fox to go to Mars. I wanted to do this becuase I think this would
a silly thing and I just want to make people laugh and most importanly I think NASA should really send a fox to Mars instead 
of the a human to see what can it do in the roketship. My picture shows that in the future that this fox has surived in space 
and every rockship has changes the tip to fox head to show that this fox has been the first animal to Mars.
