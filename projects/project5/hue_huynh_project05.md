### Project Description

A whimsical representation of the bubbles you'd see underwater, these bubbles feature a gentle white glow and tinted with randomly chosen pastel colors. This adds variety and luminosity to an otherwise nondescript underwater environment.
To create a more immersive and dynamic experience, viewers can click on a bubble to pop it. 

To create this environment, coding the initial version was performed through Processing, an open-source graphical library. The finished code was then translated and ported into p5.js where it's able to be displayed on the web. 

The biggest flaw of the project is its lack of smoothness. Due to its immense detail and amound of objects to render per second, it will cause the browser to lag and may cause the computer to consume more memory and CPU power. Because of this, I chose to exclude animated background elements such as swaying seaweed and swimming fish.
