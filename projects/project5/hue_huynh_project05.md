### Project Description

A whimsical representation of the bubbles you'd see underwater, these bubbles feature a gentle white glow and tinted with randomly chosen pastel colors. This adds variety and luminosity to an otherwise nondescript underwater environment.
To create a more immersive and dynamic experience, viewers can click on a bubble to pop it. 

To create this environment, coding the initial version was performed through Processing, an open-source graphical library. The finished code was then translated and ported into p5.js where it's able to be displayed on the web. 

The biggest flaw of the project is its lack of smoothness across browsers. Displaying the webpage in Safari or Firefox will cause the browser, possibly the whole computer as well, to lag. Lagging doesn't appear in Chrome. However, certain CSS effects such as -webkit-backdrop-filter (automatically available in Safari) will need to be enabled in Chrome's HTML experimental settings page to deliver a better experience.
