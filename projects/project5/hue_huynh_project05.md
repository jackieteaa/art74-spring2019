### Project Description

A whimsical representation of the bubbles you'd see underwater, these bubbles feature a gentle white glow and tinted with randomly chosen pastel colors. This adds variety and luminosity to an otherwise nondescript underwater environment.
To create a more immersive and dynamic experience, viewers can click on a bubble to pop it. 

To create this environment, coding the initial version was performed through Processing, an open-source graphical library. The finished code was then translated and ported into p5.js where it's able to be displayed on the web.
