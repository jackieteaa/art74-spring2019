### Project Description  
My collage integrates the Flora motif into a digital setting. Through augmented reality, the motif becomes enhanced through parallax effects and animated elements. The imagery evokes springtime, fresh aromas, as if you're feeling an arrangement of flowers from peonies to daisies to chrysanthemums. The flowers were drawn with sharp strokes as the outline and soft, brushed detailing on the inside.

The motivation behind the composition's art style arose purely from aesthetics. The arrangement of flowers, no matter how haphazardly still resulted in a visually pleasing piece. The decisions behind the approach towards augmented reality stemmed from our fourth reading. Artist Helen Papagiannis added dynamism to a plain static children's book, by adding moving insects in settings with plants. Her effort to create a more immersive experience was what drove my artistic direction. In BlippAR, I moved certain flowers forward to create a parallax effect, similar to the home screen of the iPhone. In addition, I also added butterflies which I felt complement the floral motifs.
