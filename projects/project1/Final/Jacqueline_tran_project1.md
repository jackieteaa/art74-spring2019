Description
I take slightly on the idea of Greek gods and goddesses, attempting to convey both a feeling of novelty and alluding to darkness. The concept of the idea was made while browsing for images. A piece can derive a lot of significance from its title, so the artwork might be best understood from its title: Abyss. 
	The simultaneous loss and pleasure of life resembles a deep chasm. Hopefully the audience can experience a pulling motion or radiation of energy from the center. The ballerinas are dancing callously around the chasm with parts of their body faded and missing. This represents a disconnect from each other as they swirl around the deep and alluring chasm.
