Extra Credit Assignment
My name is Deana Desilva and I am currently a sophomore attending San Jose State
University. I am an Asian American, 19 years old and am of Filipino heritage. I am majoring in
Digital Media Art and wish to venture into the world of game design as a full time career. At this
point in my art career I’m still learning many dynamics of traditional and digital, as well as
developing many useless skills for coding and 3d design. As my art develops, I’m also trying to
gain an audience for my art of different platforms of social media. My target audience are mainly
towards the anime and gaming communities. I feel like as an artist, I don’t have any set goals or
visions that I would like to communicate through my art. Although I am looking to improve in my
art, I am somewhat content with the abilities I already possess. Some examples of projects that I
did that represent or contains medias of video games in them are from Art 74, my
HypermediART project and 3D MeshMash project. My HypermediART project was based
heavily off of the video game Dark Souls. As the clips for the video were taken directly from the
game. For that project I played directly on my own account and my boyfriend had helped me in
creating and recording the scenes. This is significant because Dark Souls is just a beautiful
game. Overall i wanted to really capture the background and the environment of the game itself.
This is similar with my 3D Mesh Mash project. My 3D Mesh Mash project was heavily based off
of the game Maplestory. This is significant because Maplestory is also another video game
whose environment and settings I really enjoy. Video games like this give me some aspect of
what part of game design I would like to go in.

My twitter following consists pretty much of digital and traditional artists. There are quite
many as well who work within the game design industry. One of my favorite artists that heavily
influence my own art is @sakimi.chan on Instagram. Sakimi Chan is a Canadian digital artist
who focuses mostly on anime and video
game characters. I appreciate her work a lot
as she tries to incorporate as much realism
as possible. As well as @jubycg on
Instagram, who is an aspiring cg artist that I
get a lot of reference from when creating 3D
models. Lastly another artist who has
influenced me is @kuvshinov_ilya on
Instagram, who is a Russian Illustrator
based in Tokyo, who has done character
and visual design for the anime Birthday
Wonderland.

For recording my HypermediART project for example, i used softwares such as OBS and
adobe premiere to record and edit my clips. I’m very well versed in recording and streaming
softwares such as OBS and X Split as I use these for recording and streaming on Twitch. So
because of my experience with
these streaming programs, it was
very easy to create my Dark Souls
HypermediART project. For the
whole project though I did in fact
only stick with OBS as my main
recording system as it was open
already at the time of recording.
However X Split is just as easy to
use for recording videos and
streams as well.
