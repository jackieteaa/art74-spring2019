I was already familiar with glitch art before the reading. It's a method of interpolating data errors into digital art to create a more visually compelling piece. There are multiple ways to glitch art. The first I heard of glitch art was from accidental deletion of files. When the computer deletes a file, it's hidden until new data overwrites the deleted file. In many cases, the file can be recovered, but may be corrupted with pixelation, tiling, or gaps replaced with noise. There are other ways, such as using magnets to corrupt the physical device or causing hard drive failure. Briz's method is opening the file in a program not designed for that file, for example, opening an image file in a text editor. 

Briz also redefines the term in an artistic sense and corrects misconceptions of the art form. While 'glitch' is conventionally thought of as mistakes that the computer makes, Briz emphasizes it's a result of human error as our computers follow our instructions. He also asserts a glitch is unexpected, the computer has glitched, but the glitch is something that catches us off-guard. In the context of an image, we aren't certain of the visual result of an image after it's been glitched. Glitch art is not necessarily a medium, nor an aesthetic, but an ethic, where the artist is intentionally misusing the applications.

It's interesting as the practice is a method challenging convention. That is, the art isn't confined to its designated application rather edited in word processors or spreadsheet editors. Glitch art can be a tool of reappropriation, where past works can be recontextualized to provoke new commentary. For example, the art form can sometimes be used to comment on the relationship between society and technology. 

Ultimately, I did test out Briz's method of creating glitch art. I opened one of my .jpeg files in TextEdit and added a character. It's interesting since only certain images will have a glitch effect when edited. Many other image files I tried either made little to no difference or corrupted the file where it couldn't be open in any image application. There is another way to 'glitch' art, which is to use an application designed to distort the image or use distortion filters in Photoshop. However, I feel this would violate the ethos Briz advocates with glitch art.
