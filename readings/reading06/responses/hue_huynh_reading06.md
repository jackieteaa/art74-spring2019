  In essence, artists — authors Moreshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke challenge convention in their #Additivism Manifesto. These artists study and experiment with the potential of 3-D printing. 3-D printing technology has always been a channel for our creative aspirations. 3-D printing has already permeated fields beyond art. It’s used to prototype in fields of engineering. Often used in medical fields to print out organs. The manifesto encourages us among people of other professions to explore the political, virtual, and material aspects of 3-D prints. If to be described in a statement, “a movement that aims to disrupt material, social, computational, and metaphysical realities through provocation, collaboration, and ‘weird’.”

  This phenomenon is quite interesting to read through, yet still a bit confusing. I participating in introductory aspects of the movement will help illuminate more obscure aspects. One work I found quite interesting was ‘The Webcamera Obscura’ by authors Jasper Meiners and Isabel Paehr. In this work they tackle the cost of privacy that comes with autonomy and connection. Their work reclaims privacy through a device that covers the webcams of our devices, specifically laptops. The obscura has a socket so that we can add-on other 3-d models to reclaim agency of what our surveillants see.
