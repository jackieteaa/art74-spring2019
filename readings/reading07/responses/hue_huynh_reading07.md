I'm not familiar with Net.art at all, though I did have my presumptions about the art form. Before reading the excerpt, I presumed it was using the internet as your medium. I find the movement has a lot of advantages such as the lack of communicative constraints. Artists are able to present their art to a wide, potentially global audience. Works of net.art aren't marginalized by mainstream institutions and allow the artist to fully express their social, political, cultural beliefs without inhibition, perfect for counter-cultural movements. 

With the art form allowing us to unrestricted expression, it opens the door for unlimited possibilities, especially with the medium constantly being innovated upon. I found tne of the works of the movement, Locative Painting, quite interesting. Participants to enter their zip code to essentially create a stroke (that starts from the previous participant's position) on the painting. Then, you're sent the painting you just contributed to. It propegates community and connection that gets lost behind our screens.
