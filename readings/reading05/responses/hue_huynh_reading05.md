For the reading, I chose to research the artist John Baldessari. His work spans multiple mediums from photography to paint. Though he's most noted for his conceptual works. Most notably, the video, "I am Making Art" he displayed in 1971. It features Baldessari standing in the center moving his hands, arms, in a deadpan manner while uttering the phrase, "I am making art." Despite the similarity of his movement and tone throughout the video, there's still a level of nuance with each motion and utterance he makes. 

Maybe he was spoofing the body art/performance. It's possible he's defying the commonalities in the execution of using one's bodies in their art/performances. This isn't the only art piece that encouraged audiences to think. One work, where Baldessari burned his paintings and made cookies from the ashes. Perhaps the work was to mark a juncture of his life.
