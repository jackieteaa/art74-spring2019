I have an affinity to infographics. I believe it lets designers get creative about their work to present data in a visually pleasing way. I think one advantage it has over plain data is how it appeals to visual learner. Infographics also condenses the sources they gather into concise points that can be easily absorbed and read. In the context of the reading, due to its easily comprehensible style, it's easy to share on social media and has broad appeal. Infographics can be great storytelling with the incorporation of graphics. For example, Figure 3.5, which uses syringes to portray bars in a graph about the increase in facelifts. Or part 5 of the infographic that uses red to depict states that are installing 50MW of solar, much more interesting than simply listing it out in text. </p>

I think a downside of an infographic, which wasn't covered much in the reading, is its own advantage. Simplicity can sometimes be bad for the point you want to express. In one instance, a person can easily misconstrue the data in an infographic. For example, charts can be misinterpreted with the infographic omitting the chart's baseline or compressing the y-axis. And at times, we can't fully express the point we want to make. Implementing a paragraph or two can be counterproductive to the intent of an infographic. I believe an ideal usage of an infographic is in an article. This way, it can be used to efficiently portray data and statistics while the writing expands upon and contextualizes the data.
