I'm actually a bit familiar with Augmented Reality for a while. The biggest example of AR I can think of is Pokemon Go where players navigate in the real world to catch Pokemon. The most recent example I've seen is Target's app for furniture. Simply scan the floor and the app will project a piece of furniture into your room for you to get a sense of the size and how it interacts with other furniture.  </p>

From the reading, I was really interested in Papgiannis work. Her book that implements AR adds a level of realism by adding insects that appear and craw behind flowers. It creates a more immersive experience. I think with more visually-driven books. AR can be used to add more dimension, realism, or complexity. Another that caught my eye was Tamiko Thiel's usage of AR to alter our current environment, sparking the potential of sustainable energy, for example, watermills on top of waterways.

Overall, I do find AR has the potential to be revolutionary, and there are ample of uses that range from artistic to utilitarian purposes. I believe, while AR is currently common, it has potential to grow even more. It range range from display mockups and blueprints of buildings to creating more visually immersive experiences in museums, books, and games.
