        I found 'Understanding the Light' a great read to develop a good understanding of light and color. Parts of this reading actually served as great review. Most of the content in the reading is quite similar to subject matter taught in physics, such as wavelength, temperature, and light propagation. The definitions, however, are not as convoluted as the complex physics textbook, which makes the reading even easier to follow. <br><br>
    The reading also illuminated aspects of light and color I was initially not very familiar with. The color rendering index was something new I learned from the reading. It's a scale from 0 to 100 indicating how the light affects the appearance of color of objects. It is said that, "a source identical to standardized daylight or a Black body" will garner a value of 100, while light that poorly represent color will garner a value of 0. The reading notes an example of LEDs having a CRI of around 80 while sodium-derived lights have a CRI of around 25. In the context of art, one of the most salient topics of the reading is the two main color models, additive and subtractive. I find additive color models in digital mediums like photoshop and illustrator, where all of the colors combined form white. Subtractive color models are more common in painting and printing where all of the colors combined form black.<br><br>  Lastly, I like that the reading included an ample amount of visual information and supplementary videos that helped me better understand the subject, such as Colm Kelleher's video of color. I also appreciated how the reading included a quiz to check if we understood the content, which actually helped me better absorb information as I reread sections from questions I answered incorrectly.
