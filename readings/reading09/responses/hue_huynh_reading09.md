The video's interactivity illuminated one of the key aspects of processing. I feel processing is an easy, beginner-friendly library for digital artists that want to delve into a coding medium, but without the heavy load of documentation to wade through before they can work. These tutorials, coupled with a simple code makes it really easier for beginners to create an interactive environment. These tutorials inspired me to find examples where processing was use since I really wanted to see the potential of this software (and also to gain some inspiration for the project). I found it works great to create 2D games in the vein of Flash/swf, but without the outdated software.

However, personally, after just browsing around, looking at more tutorials and examples, I rather stick to three.js, it's a web-based, javascript library. Maybe because their examples are more exciting? But I found the library to be feature-rich and I am already really familiar from working with it for my previous project. Maybe I'll like processing simplicity, I found just trying it for a few hours a bit fun.
