A piece that caught my eye during our museum vist was Ladrāo de Tênis/Sneaker Thief by Clarissa Tossin. The work is a series of plaster casts of the interior of sneakers arranged grid-like on clear acrylic shelving. Just observing the sneakers, there are slight impressions of the Nike Swoosh, the 3 Stripes of Adidas, and the circular converse patch. In the description, the work is meant to shed a light on the complex conflicts in Brazil, specifically the frequently covered topic of people getting killed over a pair of sneakers. Tossin also touches on the income disparities and materialism in a developing, capitalist economy. I think closer observing these casts makes the work more immersive as we can better see the imperfections, texture, and tear that occured throughout the life of these sneakers. Possibly capturing the person's life and identity through the wear and tear helps us better understand the lives of the people that walk in these sneakers.
